# Hangman â€” Python CLI Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic **Hangman** game, written in Python. Try to guess the hidden word, one letter at a time, before you run out of lives!

## Features

- ASCII art hangman stages for visual feedback
- Randomly selected words from a customizable list
- Tracks and displays correct guesses and remaining lives
- Informs the user about repeated guesses and incorrect attempts
- Shows the correct word if the player loses

## How to Play

1. **Run the script**:
    ```bash
    python hangman.py
    ```
2. The game will display a series of underscores representing the hidden word.
3. Guess one letter at a time by typing it and pressing Enter.
4. If the letter is in the word, all instances are revealed.
5. If the letter is not in the word, you lose a life and the hangman drawing progresses.
6. The game ends when you either guess all the letters or run out of lives.
